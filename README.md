# Before You Begin

Have one member of your group create a new repository, named Crowdfunding_ETL, for this project. Add your partner as a collaborator. Do not add this project to an existing repository.

Clone the new repository to your computer.

Have one person rename the ETL_Mini_Project_starter_code.ipynb file with the first name initial and last name of each member of the group, for example, ETL_Mini_Project_NRomanoff_JSmith.ipynb. Then, add this Jupyter notebook file and the Resources folder containing the crowdfunding.xlsx and the contacts.xlsx files to your repository.

Push the changes to GitHub.

Have your partner pull the changes, so both of you have the same notebook available on your computer.

As you work through the project deliverables, you may find it helpful to break up the work across other notebooks that you each work on individually. However, once complete, please combine all the subsections back into the final ETL_Mini_Project notebook.

A "category" column that contains only the category titles

The following image shows this category DataFrame:
